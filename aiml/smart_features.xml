            🎯 Here's a proven study tip:
            
            Use the Pomodoro Technique: Study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. After 4 sessions, take a longer 15-30 minute break.
            
            Why it works:
            • Maintains focus and energy
            • Prevents burnout
            • Improves retention
            
            Try saying "pomodoro timer" to get started!
